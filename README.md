## Important note about me (@ramtinak)
I don't use Instagram at all and I don't like it either, so when you across to an issue or wanna new feature, describe it as much as you can!

## Contract, warning, note
Every method returns object IS NOT COMPLETED YET!
For example:
```
Task<IResult<object>>
```
